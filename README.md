# Real-speed

Real-speed is a small side project that measures your **real internet speed** in **MB/s** (not that fake ISP marketing bluff).

## How it works

Real-speed is fully powered by **Cloudflare**.  
The website requests random data in small **64 KB** chunks and performs background calculations to determine your actual download speed.

No fluff. Just raw data doing its thing.

## How to use

Just open the website:  
https://realspeed.ct.ws/

That’s it.

If any issues pop up (because tech loves being annoying), the web app also works fine on a local server or directly in your browser.
